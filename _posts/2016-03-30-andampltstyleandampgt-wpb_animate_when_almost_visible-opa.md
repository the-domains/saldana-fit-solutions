About Coach Sal: Who I am: 

Hi, I'm Coach Sal.  I started my coaching career in 2004\. Over the years I have  had the pleasure of coaching a diverse range of individuals, ages, and lifestyles in a great many places.  

After being sent to Fort Huachuca in Arizona, a decision to finally plant roots was made. Thus enabling my dedication and love for coaching to continue here for the military and their spouses stationed here at Fort Huachuca and the wonderful people of the sierra vista area. 

I have a genuine passion for coaching. I love what I do and want nothing more than to see my clients succeed. My aspiration is to get you living with less limitation. I want to see you living stronger, healthier, happier.... totally empowered and believing in your self. I put everything I have into your success because I truly care. 

In addition to the title Coach, I am an Army wife and mother. I totally get the "crazy-hectic make no time for me" demands life can put on us. Oh yes, the moving, parenting, working, and keeping balance in the home. I also am familiar with what kind of chaos occurs (body and mind) when we are not a priority to ourselves.
